problem statement:
We want a distributed object store with the following properties:
    - Per-object logging
    - Idempotent communications
    - Central RSM server
    - Mutable objects
    - Demand-driven synchronization
    - Push notifications
    - Access control
    - Relationship schema
    - Automated application-defined rebasing
    - Optimistic consistency
    - Snapshots
    - Weak denormalized references
    - Stored procedures

Each scalar should have a cloud of weak references attached to it.
Getting an update to a scalar should automatically unpack the weak references.
A weak reference is (id version blob).  A strong reference is an id.
Mutating an object creates an edit and appends it to the object's log.
Pulling fetches the log suffix for all objects I ask for, then rebases my edits.
Pushing sends my edits to the server, and gets back the latest version of each id.
If the latest version is not what I expected, I might want to pull again.
A scalar can be in a deleted state -- in this case, all functions return None. (?)
An edit can abort by raising an exception, in which case it is a NOP.
